==========================
Welcome To Opentrons Docs!
==========================

The Opentrons API is a simple Python framework designed to make writing automated biology lab protocols easy.

Weâ€™ve designed it in a way we hope is accessible to anyone with basic Python and wetlab skills. As a bench scientist, you should be able to code your automated protocols in a way that reads like a lab notebook.

**********************

Getting Started
---------------

New to Python? Check out our :ref:`writing` page first before continuing. To get a sense of the typical structure of our scripts, take a look at our :ref:`examples` page.

Our API requires Python version 3.6.4 or later. Once this is set up on your computer, you can simply use `pip` to install the Opentrons package.

.. code-block:: python

    pip install opentrons

To simulate protocols on your laptop, check out :ref:`simulate-block`. When you're ready to run your script on a robot, download our latest `desktop app`__
